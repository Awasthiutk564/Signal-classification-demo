# Signal Classification (Simple ML Project)

**Short:** Ye project synthetic signals (sine, square, sawtooth, noisy) generate karke unko classify karta hai using a simple ML model.  
Project beginner-friendly hai aur hackathon/demo ke liye ready.

## What I did
- Generated synthetic signals (sine, square, sawtooth, noisy).
- Trained a simple classifier that predicts signal type.
- Displayed one signal plot and printed prediction + accuracy.

## How to run (local)
1. Python installed hona chahiye (3.10+ recommended).  
2. Required libraries install karo:
3. Run the script:
4. Script terminal me model accuracy print karega aur ek plot popup open karega showing the signal and predicted label.

## Files
- `signal_classification.py` — main script (data generation, training, test, plot)  
- `README.md` — this file

## Notes / Demo
- Example output: model achieved very high accuracy on synthetic data and correctly predicted signal types (sine/square/etc.).  
- Next steps (optional): save model, make a web app (Streamlit), add more signal types, push to GitHub.
